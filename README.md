# how_to_github

Get some project:

git clone URL

See the status of your github branch:

git status

After doing changes, see which are those changes:

git diff FILE

Adding a file when it's right:

git add FILE

Adding all your changes in files that are already there:

git add -u

Commiting those changes:
 
git commit -m "Explain the change"

Uploading them into github:

git push

When you are working with someone else, first get the last changes of your colleague:

git pull
